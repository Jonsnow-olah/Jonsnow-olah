- 👋 Hi, I’m Israel
- 🌱 I’m a full-stack Javascript( 4 years experience) and PHP developer( 4 years experience) currently exploring opportunities in the web3 space.
- ☃️ you might be wondering why I have a regulated NFT as a PFP, well that's because I am currently exploring opportunities in the web3 space like i said earlier.
- 👀 I love coding because I love solving complex problems and building stuff that people can use and wow at.
- 🤩 Oh and I also love making people laugh, trust me, I am not much of a comedian, but I have a telegram channel dedicated to only memes, just search for jonsnowmemes on telegram and have a nice day😂😂
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just anything available because I have tons of free time on my end at the moment.
- 🧭 If you also want to explore the web3 space with me, you can check out my telegram channel just for crypto updates and airdrops, just search for jonsnowcrypto.
